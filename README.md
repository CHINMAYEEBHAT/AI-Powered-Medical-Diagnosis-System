# AI-Powered-Medical-Diagnosis-System
The increasing prevalence of chronic diseases necessitates early detection and accurate diagnosis to improve patient outcomes. This project presents an AI-powered medical diagnosis system that utilizes machine learning models to predict diseases based on user-inputted symptoms and risk factors. 
The system is implemented as an interactive web application using Streamlit, enabling users to select a disease, input relevant parameters, and receive predictive insights in real time.
The objective of this project is to enhance accessibility to preliminary medical assessments by leveraging machine learning algorithms. The system currently supports the prediction of multiple diseases, including Lung Cancer, Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, and Hypothyroidism. Users provide input through an intuitive form, where features like age, smoking habits, anxiety levels, chronic disease history, and fatigue contribute to the predictive model’s decision-making.
The methodology involves collecting and preprocessing medical datasets, training machine learning models using supervised learning techniques, and integrating them into a web-based application. The backend utilizes classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, ensuring high accuracy in disease prediction. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score validate the model’s performance.
The key results indicate that the AI system provides reliable predictions, assisting users in identifying potential health risks. While it does not replace professional medical diagnosis, it serves as an initial screening tool, prompting users to seek medical attention when necessary.
In conclusion, this AI-driven system enhances early disease detection and improves healthcare accessibility, particularly in remote areas with limited medical resources. Future improvements include expanding disease coverage, refining model accuracy, and integrating real-time health monitoring for a more comprehensive diagnosis system.
